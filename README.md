# NCIt OBO Edition
This project aims to develop an [OBO Library](http://obofoundry.org)-friendly release of the [NCI Thesaurus](https://ncit.nci.nih.gov/ncitbrowser/). Goals include adopting OBO conventions for term identifiers and ontology dereferencing, as well as improved semantic integration with existing OBO ontologies. We are working in collaboration with NCI staff under NCI/Leidos contract #17X118.

## Download
The OBO edition is currently a work in progress, so ontology content may change frequently. The in-progress ontology is available here: http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/ncit.owl

Additional downloads may be available in the [project wiki](https://github.com/NCI-Thesaurus/thesaurus-obo-edition/wiki).
